		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>There's a nation of about 10m people you have probably never heard about.</p>
		<p>This website has all the basic information about the Tatars, mainly of Volga origin</p>
		<p>There's not much you can find in the Internet about them. Despite well-known or often mixed up with other nationalities,
		Tatars proudly sustain their rich traditions, remember their drammatic history and still cook delicious dishes.</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<img class="feat-img_history" src="img/bulgars.jpg" alt="Drinks and eats">
		<p> Tatars inhabiting the Republic of Tatarstan, a federal subject of Russia, constitute one third of all Tatars, while the other two thirds reside outside Tatarstan. The formation of some of the communities residing outside Tatarstan took place before the Russian Revolution of 1917 due to Tatars being specialized in trading.

		The emergence of ethnonym "Tatar" is disputed, with two theses trying to explain its origins. Mongol thesis, according to which etymology can be traced back to the Chinese "Ta-Tan" or "Da-Dan", is more widely accepted than Turkic one. Ethnonym "Tatar" first emerged in the fifth century BC.

		<p>The 14th century saw the spread of Sunni Islam among the Tatars. Tatars became subjects of Russia after the Siege of Kazan in 1552. Since Russians linked Tatars with the Mongol Golden Horde (that ruled Russia in the 13th century), they began to negatively stereotype the Tatar people. Due to these negative stereotypes, some of which persist in modern Russian society, recently some Tatar intellectuals have been trying to link Tatar heritage with the historic Bulgar population of today's Tatarstan. Russians were using the Tatar ethnonym during the 18th and 19th centuries to denote all Turkic inhabitants of the Russian Empire, however the Turkic peoples of the Russian Empire before the emergence of the Soviet Union did not usually self-identify as Tatars. Up to the end of the 19th century, Volga Tatars mainly identified themselves as Muslims until the rehabilitation of the ethnonym Tatar occurred. Russian officials used literary Tatar language to interact with the Turkic peoples of the Russian Empire before the end of 19th century. Volga Tatar role in the Muslim national and cultural movements of the Russian Empire before the 1917 Revolution is significant and this situation continued even after 1917. Tatar authorities attempted in the 1990s to reverse the Russification of Tatarstan that took place during the Soviet period</p>

		<p><strong>Bulgarism: </strong>"Bulgarism" is a term for the position that the Volga Tatars are significantly descended from the Volga Bulgars.

		A more accepted position, however, is that the Volga Tatar ethnogenesis was completed upon the arrival of the Kipchaks, Cumans and Mongols to the lands inhabited by the Volga Bulgars.</p>

		<h2>Traditions</h2>
		<p><strong>Kurash: </strong>The wrestling Kurash, is the main competition of Sabantuy. Wrestlers use towels and the aim is to knock down the opponent.
		Usually young boys start the competition. At the end of Sabantuy, the main event of the festival is the final of kurash. The winner becomes the batyr, the hero of the Sabantuy. The prize varies from a ram in small villages to a car at big cities' celebrations.</p>
		<p><strong>Horse-riding: </strong>Oh, we just love it. But if a horse will dissapoint us, we will make Kazy (traditional sausage) out of it!</p>-->
