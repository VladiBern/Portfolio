		<h2>Tatar Language</h2>
		<img class="language-img" src="img/language.png" alt="language">
		<p>The Tatar language is a Turkic language spoken by Volga Tatars mainly located in modern Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. It should not be confused with the Crimean Tatar language, to which it is remotely related but with which it is not mutually intelligible.</p>
		<p><strong>Geographic distribution: </strong>The Tatar language is spoken in Russia (about 5.3 million people), Ukraine, China, Finland, Turkey, Uzbekistan, the United States of America, Romania, Azerbaijan, Israel, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Lithuania, Latvia, and other countries. There are more than 7 million speakers of Tatar in the world.

		Tatar is also native for several thousand Maris. Mordva's Qaratay group also speak a variant of Kazan Tatar.

		In the 2010 census, 69% of Russian Tatars who responded to the question about language ability claimed a knowledge of the Tatar language. In Tatarstan, 93% of Tatars and 3,6% of Russians did so. In neighbouring Bashkortostan, 67% of Tatars, 27% of Bashkirs, and 1,3% of Russians did</p>
		<p>There's not much you can find in the Internet about them. Despite well-known or often mixed up with other nationalities,
		Tatars proudly sustain their rich traditions, remember their drammatic history and still cook delicious dishes.</p>
		<p><strong>Dialects: </strong>There are three main dialects of Tatar: Western (Mishar), Middle (Kazan), and Eastern (Siberian). All of these dialects also have subdivisions. Significant contribution to the study of the Tatar language and its dialects, were made by a famous scientist, Doctor of Science in Philology, Professor Gabdulkhay Akhatov, who is considered to be the founder of the modern Tatar dialectological school.</p>

		<h2>Traditions</h2>
		<p><strong>Kurash: </strong>The wrestling Kurash, is the main competition of Sabantuy. Wrestlers use towels and the aim is to knock down the opponent.
		Usually young boys start the competition. At the end of Sabantuy, the main event of the festival is the final of kurash. The winner becomes the batyr, the hero of the Sabantuy. The prize varies from a ram in small villages to a car at big cities' celebrations.</p>
		<p><strong>Horse-riding: </strong>Oh, we just love it. But if a horse will dissapoint us, we will make Kazy (traditional sausage) out of it!</p>
